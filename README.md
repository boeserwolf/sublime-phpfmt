# [php.fmt](https://github.com/dericofilho/php.tools) support for Sublime Text 2/3


php.fmt and php.tools aim to help PHP development. One of the features, code formatting, now is embeded too in ST3. For now it formats automatically when you save the PHP file.


### Installation
Install this plugin through Package Manager. 

It runs better with PHP 5.5 or newer installed in the machine running the plugin. Although there are reports saying it works seemingly correctly with PHP 5.3.24, however slow.


### Settings
```
// This option enabled the experimental formatting which complies with PSR1 and PSR2 standards
"psr1_and_2":false,
"php_bin":"/usr/local/bin/php"
```
